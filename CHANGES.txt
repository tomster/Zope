Plone Conference 2008 sprint
============================

claytron sprinted on ZopeSkel:

- Bringing the bundle up to date with some best practices. The AT field snippets will work in conjunction with ZopeSkel a little better now. 
- fixed formatting of AT fields 
- used atapi import for the ATCTContent template and field snippets 
- added a computed field snippet 
- fixed up some zcml to follow best practices (http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/ZCMLStyleGuide) 
- removed tabs and fixed formatting for schema snippets 
- added schema.<field> for the schemas so that you only need one import 
- made the pdb tab trigger be 'pdb' instead of 'trace' 
- changed the GS profile registration to be the ZCML 
- added GS importStep and GS exportStep ZCML 
- added GS upgrade step and group steps ZCML snippets 
- removed the GenericSetup language, as it was only for a few files, and not scalable 
- changed the pyflakes command to run on save and give you a tooltip with syntax errors (if pyflakes is not installed then nothing happens, not even a warning) 
- reordered the snippets to be grouped a bit better 

Thanks to hexsprite and limi for the motivation to fix it up :)
